               EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASE:
                    WHO RESPONDS TO A GLOBAL THREAT

     The World Health Organization called for the establishment of a global
network of scientific centre to identify and combat new or re-emerging
diseases, including those caused by antibodic-resistant strains of
infectious agents, that threaten the lives of countless millions of people.

     International experts are meeting at WHO headquartes in Geneva today
because of growing concern about such diseases, and the relate problems of
their spread by international travel, the international exchange of
foodstuffs and live animals, and resitance to antibodics. Under the chair-
manship of Nobel prize-winner, Professor Joshua Lederberg, of Rockefeller
University, New York, the experts are discussing how the planned network of
surveillance and monitoring centres can be set up.

     New and re-emerging infectious diseases are those have been recently
discovered, have increased in humans during the last 20 years, of threaten
to grow in the near future. The most dramatic example is AIDS, due to the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) whose existence was unkown barely 10
years ago. The resurgence of tuberculosis, including antibiotic-resistant
strains, and the spread of other diseases regarded until recently as under
control - such as cholera, yellow fever, and dengue - are further examples.

     In addition, there have been recent expidemics of infections due to
contaminated food and public water supplies, and the emergence of new
diseases, such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. This hitherto unrecognized
disease was recently discovered in the southwestern United States. It is
caused by a previously unknown hantavirus, transmitted to humans by field
mice, and has been fatal in more than half the 60 cases now identified.

     The last few years have also seen the emergence of a completely new
strain of cholera in Asia; and, in South America, Venezuelan haemorrhagic
fever and Brazilian haemorrhagic fever - both fatal and both caused by
newly-recognized arenaviruses, related to that which causes Lassa fever in
Africa.

     "These examples vividly illustrate that the world remains extrmely
vulvnerable to new and re-emerging infections and emphasizes the need for
increased vigilance", said Dr James Le Duc, of WHO's Division of
Communicable Diseases, and organizer of today's meeting. "They also show
the urgent need for a better global system to identify these infectious
agents and permit a timely response."

     In 1993, the biggest outbreak of water-borne illness ever recorded in
the United States occurred - more than 400 000 people in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, suffered prolonged diarrhoea, and about 4400 of them needed
hospital treatment. The cause: water supplies contaminated by human or
animal faeces containing the intestinal parasite Cryptospridium.

     Other examples of resurgence of infectious diseases in 1993 include
cholera in Latin America, yellow fever in Kenya - where outbreaks of the
disease had never been revorded before - outbreaks of illness caused by the
food-borne bacterium, Escherichia coli (E.coli) in South Africa and
Swaziland, dengue in Costa Rica, and diphtheria in Russia.

     Many of the infections are zoonotic - that is, they orginate in
animals. During the last seven years, a large number of zoonoses and
potentially zoonotic diseases have appeared worldwide.

     They can be grouped in three main categories: those associated with
changing farming practices, food processing, trade and consumer habits,
such as Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni and E.coli, those
linked to changing environmental conditions, such as Rift Valley fever; and
pathogens acquiring new properties through adaption, mutation and
recombination, such as influenza viruses, which infect both humans and
animals.

     Salmonella enteritidis is one of the major food-borne pathogens.
Transmitted mainly through consumption of infected eggs-derived products,
the number of cases in humans has increased dramatically during the past
dozen or so years. A number of animal diseases, such as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), have also required careful assessment and monitoring.

     "These are clearly not rare events and with the increasing human
population, the related environmental changes and urbanization, as well as
ever-increasing trade and travel and travel, we can expect to see more
epidemics of zoontotic diseases", said Dr Francois-Xavier Meslin, Chief of
WHO's Veterinary Public Health Unit in Geneva.

     "Zoonosis surveillance systems are still dangerously deficient in many
places in the world, so that an emering zoonotic problem may be undetected
in its animal reservoir for a while, until it occurs in humans and reaches
such a magnitude that control requires huge efforts and expense. We
strongly support the establishment of a global network such as is being
proposed at this meeting."

     Dr Fritz KÑferstein, Chief of WHO's Food Safety Unit, said: " A
substantial percentage of all reemerging infections are related to food.
There is an urgent need for all countries to strengthen their food safety
programmes in order to prevent further occurrences of food-borne
infections. In addition, food-borne disease surveillance systems have to be
improved to enable the early detection of these problems before they reach
unmanageable proportions".

     Dr Le Duc said: "WHO has a key role to play in coordinating infectious
disease control worldwide, and already is a focal point for surveillance
data on a number of globally important infectious diseases, including HIV-
related illnesses and influenza. We hope that through the projects proposed
at this meeting we will develop a framework to build scientific capacity
and infrastructure, especially among developing countries, and to increase
global communications so that outbreaks of communicable are promptly
recognised and responded to appropriatley". Plans to implement
recommendations made at this meeting will be formulated at a session
tomorrow with representatives of the WHO Regional Offices.
